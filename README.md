# Mobil-application-MonTrack
 The Montrack application is an application where budget tracking can be done easily on mobile devices that we carry with us at all times. Montrack application is an application with user login. By providing user login, income and expense transactions are carried out by selecting the method requested by the user from the main page. The amount of money spent and the transactions made are kept in the database, ensuring that they are not lost and kept up to date. By creating the application in this way, it is ensured that people can follow their budgets easily and comfortably. Android Studio and SQL for the database are the leading methods and technologies used in the project.
